# The Lonely Dragon

A dragon named Ember lived alone on a mountain. He wished for friends but everyone was afraid of him. One day, a brave girl climbed the mountain and befriended Ember. She showed the villagers that the dragon was gentle and kind.

Ember was no longer lonely, and the village gained a new friend and protector.
