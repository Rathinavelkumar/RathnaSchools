# The Gardener and the Golden Blossom

An old gardener discovered a golden blossom in his garden. The flower granted wishes, but only if the wishes were kind and selfless. The gardener used his wishes to help his neighbors, bringing happiness to the whole village.

The golden blossom taught everyone the value of generosity and kindness.
