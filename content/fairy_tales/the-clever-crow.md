# The Clever Crow

On a hot day, a thirsty crow searched for water. He found a pitcher with only a little water at the bottom. The clever crow picked up small stones and dropped them into the pitcher. The water level rose, and the crow was able to drink.

This story reminds us that intelligence and resourcefulness can solve even the trickiest problems.
