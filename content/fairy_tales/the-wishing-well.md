# The Wishing Well

In a small village, there was a wishing well that granted wishes only to those with pure hearts. Many tried, but only a kind girl named Anya received her wish. She asked for happiness for her family and friends, and the wellâ€™s magic filled the village with joy.

The wishing well became a symbol of hope and kindness for everyone.
