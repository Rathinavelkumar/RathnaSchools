# Little Red Riding Hood

Once upon a time, there was a sweet girl who was loved by everyone, especially her grandmother. One day, her mother asked her to take some cake and wine to her sick grandmother who lived in the woods. Wearing her red cloak, the girl set off on her journey.

On the way, she met a wolf who cunningly found out where her grandmother lived. The wolf reached the house first, disguised himself as the grandmother, and waited for Little Red Riding Hood. When she arrived, she noticed something strange about her grandmother. Soon, she realized it was the wolf! Luckily, a passing huntsman heard her cries and rescued both her and her grandmother.

From then on, Little Red Riding Hood promised never to stray from the path again.
