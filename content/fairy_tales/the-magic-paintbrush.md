# The Magic Paintbrush

Lila received a paintbrush that brought her drawings to life. She painted food for the hungry and houses for the homeless. But when a greedy man tried to steal the brush, it stopped working for him.

Lila continued to use her gift to help others, showing that kindness makes magic real.
