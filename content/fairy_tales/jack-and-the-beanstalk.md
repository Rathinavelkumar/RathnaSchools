# Jack and the Beanstalk

Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack who lived with his mother. They were very poor, and their only possession was a cow. One day, Jack’s mother asked him to sell the cow at the market. On his way, Jack met a mysterious man who offered him magic beans for the cow. Jack accepted, and when he returned home, his mother was furious and threw the beans out the window.

The next morning, Jack awoke to find a gigantic beanstalk growing outside his window. He climbed up the beanstalk and discovered a land high above the clouds, where a giant lived in a castle. Jack had many adventures, eventually outsmarting the giant and returning home with treasures that changed his family’s fortune forever.

And they lived happily ever after.
