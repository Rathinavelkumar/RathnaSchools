# Java Programming Language

Java is a powerful, versatile, object-oriented programming language used for building cross-platform applications. It is widely used in enterprise, mobile (Android), web, and embedded systems development.

## History of Java
- **James Gosling** developed Java at Sun Microsystems in 1995.
- Java was designed with the philosophy of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA).
- Over the years, Java has evolved with major versions introducing new features (generics, lambdas, streams, modules, etc.).

## Where is Java Used?
- **Enterprise Applications**: Banking, insurance, and large-scale business software.
- **Android Development**: Most Android apps are written in Java.
- **Web Applications**: Java is used for server-side applications via frameworks like Spring.
- **Embedded Systems**: Java powers smart cards, sensors, and IoT devices.
- **Scientific Computing**: Used in scientific and research communities for simulations and calculations.

## Characteristics of Java
- **Object-Oriented**: Supports OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **Platform Independent**: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Strongly Typed**: Variables must be declared with a type and type checking is enforced.
- **Automatic Memory Management**: Java uses garbage collection to manage memory.
- **Rich Standard Library**: Extensive APIs for networking, data structures, GUI, and more.
- **Secure & Robust**: Features like exception handling, strong type checking, and security manager.
