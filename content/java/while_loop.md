# While Loop in Java

The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of statements as long as a condition is true.

## Example
```java
int count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    System.out.println(count);
    count++;
}
```

## do-while Loop
```java
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 3);
```
